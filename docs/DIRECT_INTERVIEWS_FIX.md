# Direct Interviews Display Fix

## Problem
Employers can schedule interviews directly with candidates without going through a job application process. These direct interviews were not being displayed on the candidate side because the system was only showing interviews linked to job applications.

## Solution
Created a comprehensive solution to fetch and display both application-linked interviews and direct interviews on the candidate side.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Candidate Interview Hook (`src/hooks/candidate/useInterviews.js`)
- **Purpose**: Fetch both types of interviews for candidates
- **Features**:
  - Fetches application-linked interviews (interviews with `job_application_id`)
  - Fetches direct interviews (interviews with `seeker_id` but no `job_application_id`)
  - Transforms data to a consistent format for UI display
  - Provides filtering and status management capabilities
  - Includes security checks to ensure data belongs to the authenticated user

### 2. Updated Candidate InterviewsPage (`src/pages/candidate/InterviewsPage.jsx`)
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced dummy data with real data from the new `useInterviews` hook
  - Added support for both interview types with visual indicators
  - Added type filter to distinguish between application interviews and direct invitations
  - Improved UI with better status indicators and interview information
  - Added loading and error states

### 3. Updated Applications Store (`src/store/applicationsStore.js`)
- **Changes**:
  - Fixed security check for direct interviews (they're already filtered by `seeker_id`)
  - Ensured direct interviews are properly mapped to application-like structure
  - Added `isDirectInterview` flag to distinguish direct invitations

### 4. Updated Applications Store Hook (`src/hooks/candidate/useApplicationsStore.js`)
- **Changes**:
  - Updated tab counts to include direct interviews in the interview count
  - Updated statistics to include direct interviews in the interviewing count
  - Modified filtered data logic to include direct interviews in the interview tab

### 5. Updated ApplicationsPage (`src/pages/candidate/ApplicationsPage.jsx`)
- **Changes**:
  - Modified interview tab to show both application-linked and direct interviews
  - Added proper filtering logic for the interview tab
  - Added empty state message explaining both interview types

### 6. ApplicationCard Component (`src/components/candidate/ApplicationCard.jsx`)
- **Status**: Already had support for direct interviews
- **Features**:
  - Shows "Direct Invitation" badge for direct interviews
  - Displays appropriate status text and timeline
  - Handles interview scheduling information

### 7. Added Test Data Migration (`database/migrations/003_add_test_direct_interviews.sql`)
- **Purpose**: Provides sample direct interviews for testing
- **Features**:
  - Creates test direct interview invitations
  - Uses existing job seeker profiles, jobs, and interviewers
  - Includes realistic interview data with agendas and meeting links

## Database Schema Support
The existing `interviews` table already supports direct interviews with these key fields:
- `seeker_id`: Links to job seeker profile (for direct interviews)
- `job_id`: Links to the job (for direct interviews)
- `job_application_id`: NULL for direct interviews, populated for application-linked interviews

## Security Considerations
- Direct interviews are filtered by `seeker_id` (job seeker profile ID)
- Application-linked interviews are filtered by `applicant_id` (user profile ID)
- All queries include proper user authentication checks
- Data isolation is verified to ensure users only see their own interviews

## UI/UX Improvements
- **Visual Distinction**: Direct invitations have purple badges vs blue for application interviews
- **Clear Labeling**: "Direct Invitation" vs "Application" badges
- **Comprehensive Information**: Shows interviewer, meeting details, agenda, etc.
- **Filtering Options**: Users can filter by interview type and status
- **Statistics**: Updated counts to include both interview types

## Testing
To test the functionality:
1. Run the migration: `003_add_test_direct_interviews.sql`
2. Navigate to the candidate InterviewsPage
3. Check the ApplicationsPage interview tab
4. Verify that direct interviews appear with proper badges and information

## Future Enhancements
- Add notification system for new direct interview invitations
- Implement interview rescheduling for direct interviews
- Add calendar integration for direct interviews
- Create email templates for direct interview invitations
