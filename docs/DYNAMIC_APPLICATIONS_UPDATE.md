# Dynamic Applications Page Update

## Overview
The ApplicationsPage has been updated to use real data from Supabase instead of dummy data. This includes dynamic fetching of job applications, AI-matched jobs, and offers.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Hooks Created

#### `useJobApplications.js`
- Fetches all job applications for a job seeker
- Includes job and company details through Supabase joins
- Maps data to a flat structure for easier UI use
- Handles loading states and errors

#### `useAIMatchedJobs.js`
- Fetches AI-matched jobs based on user profile and preferences
- Calculates match scores based on skills, experience, and location preferences
- Sorts jobs by relevance and returns top matches
- Integrates with job seeker profile data

#### `useOffers.js`
- Fetches job offers for a candidate
- Currently uses job_applications table with 'offered' status
- Can be updated when a dedicated offers table is created
- Provides offer structure with compensation and relocation details

### 2. Updated ApplicationsPage.jsx
- Replaced dummy data imports with dynamic hooks
- Added loading and error states for better UX
- Updated data filtering to work with new data structure
- Integrated with user authentication and profile data
- Added proper error handling and loading indicators

### 3. Updated ApplicationCard.jsx
- Made component more flexible to work with different data structures
- Added support for match scores and cover notes
- Improved null safety with optional chaining
- Updated date formatting to handle missing dates

### 4. Updated ApplicationDetailPanel.jsx
- Already compatible with new data structure
- Uses fallback data from both job and application objects
- Maintains all AI insights and recommendations functionality

## Database Schema Used

The implementation uses the following Supabase tables:

```sql
-- Job applications table
create table public.job_applications (
  id uuid not null default extensions.uuid_generate_v4 (),
  job_id uuid not null,
  applicant_id uuid not null,
  cover_note text null,
  ai_match_score numeric null,
  status text not null default 'applied'::text,
  employer_notes text null,
  application_date timestamp with time zone null default now(),
  updated_at timestamp with time zone null default now(),
  constraint job_applications_pkey primary key (id),
  constraint job_applications_job_id_applicant_id_key unique (job_id, applicant_id),
  constraint job_applications_applicant_id_fkey foreign KEY (applicant_id) references profiles (id),
  constraint job_applications_job_id_fkey foreign KEY (job_id) references jobs (id)
);

-- Jobs table (referenced)
create table public.jobs (
  id uuid not null default extensions.uuid_generate_v4 (),
  title text not null,
  location text,
  job_type text,
  salary_range jsonb,
  is_remote boolean default false,
  experience_level integer,
  required_skills text[],
  description text,
  status text default 'active',
  company_id uuid references companies(id),
  created_at timestamp with time zone default now()
);

-- Companies table (referenced)
create table public.companies (
  id uuid not null default extensions.uuid_generate_v4 (),
  name text not null,
  logo_url text,
  industry text,
  size text,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default now()
);
```
