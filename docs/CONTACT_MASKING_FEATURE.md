# Contact Information Masking Feature

## Overview

The contact information masking feature protects candidate privacy by hiding sensitive contact details until interviews are scheduled. This ensures that employers cannot access personal contact information without first committing to an interview process.

## How It Works

### Contact Information Masking

- **Phone Numbers**: Shows only the last 2 digits (e.g., "xxx-xxx-90" for "1234567890")
- **Locations**: Shows city and country only, masks specific addresses
- **Email**: Shows "xxx@xxx.com" when masked
- **Visual Indicators**: Shows "Contact Hidden" badges and eye-off icons

### When Information is Masked

Contact information is masked when:
- No interviews are scheduled for the candidate
- All scheduled interviews are in "pending" or "cancelled" status

### When Information is Revealed

Contact information is revealed when:
- At least one interview is in "confirmed" or "scheduled" status

## Implementation Details

## User Experience

### For Employers

2. **Reduces Spam**: Protects candidates from unsolicited contact
3. **Encourages Proper Process**: Ensures interviews are scheduled before contact
4. **Compliance**: Helps meet privacy regulations and best practices

## Example Scenarios

### Before Interview Scheduling
```
Phone: xxx-xxx-89

Status: Contact Hidden
```

### After Interview Scheduling
```
Phone: 8978678989
Location: Kochi, India
Status: Contact Available
```

## Testing

The feature includes comprehensive tests in `src/utils/contactMasking.test.js` covering:
- Phone number masking logic
- Location masking logic
- Interview status detection
- Edge cases and error handling

## Future Enhancements

1. **Granular Control**: Allow candidates to choose what information to mask
2. **Time-based Revealing**: Automatically reveal contact after certain time periods
3. **Interview Status Integration**: Better integration with interview scheduling system
4. **Audit Logging**: Track when contact information is revealed
